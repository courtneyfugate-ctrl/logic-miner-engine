# Logic Miner V.5 - Algebraic Discovery Engine

## Universal Blackbox Directive
This project implements a universal algebraic engine designed to derive logical structure from any data stream (Natural Language, Mathematical Logic, Cryptography).

### Key Architectural Constraints:
1.  **Siloed Pre-processing**: Transformations (e.g. Text -> Adjacency Matrix) are strictly separated from the engine core.
2.  **Universal Solver**: The engine accepts only abstract mathematical objects (Matrices, Integer Sets).
3.  **Algebraic Discovery**: Hierarchy and directionality are discovered via **Mahler Energy Minimization** and **$p$-adic Valuations**, never imposed by semantic weights.

### Engine Components:
*   `LogicMiner`: The router and primary interface.
*   `AlgebraicTextSolver`: The core $p$-adic topology optimizer.
*   `TextFeaturizer`: A siloed utility for converting language traces into mathematical adjacency graphs.

## Research Direction: The "Flat Logic" Rectification
We are currently refining the **Recursive Re-Mapping Loop** to resolve "Valuation Inversion." By optimizing the Gödel integer mapping, the engine discovers true taxonomical depth (Phylum $\to$ Class $\to$ Species) through algebraic convergence ($|a_n|_p \to 0$).
